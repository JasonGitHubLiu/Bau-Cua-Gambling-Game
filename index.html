    <h2>The game "Bau Cua Ca Cop" ("squash-crab-fish-tiger") is a Vietnamese gambling game using three dice.
        The six sides of the dice, instead of showing one to six, they have pictures of a fish, a prawn, a crab, a rooster, a gourd, and a deer.
        Players place wagers on a board that has the six pictures, betting on which pictures will appear.</h2>

        <h3> If one die corresponds with a bet, the better receives the same amount as their bet. </h3>
        <h3>If two dice correspond with a bet, the better receives two times their money.</h3> 
        <h3>If three dice correspond with a bet, the better receives three times their money.</h3>

        <h2>"Bau Cua Ca Cop" is essentially the Vietnamese variation of "Hoo Hey How" (Fish-Prawn-Crab) played in China, the dice game Crown and Anchor played by British sailors,
        or chuck-a-luck played in America. "Bau Cua Ca Cop" is often played during Vietnamese New Year.</h2>
